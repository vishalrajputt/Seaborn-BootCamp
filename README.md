# Seaborn-BootCamp
A comprehensive tutorial for learning Python's Seaborn package. 
Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is particularly well suited for visualizing complex datasets with multiple variables. It provides a variety of plot types, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps, that are designed to work seamlessly with data in Pandas DataFrames. Seaborn also has a number of built-in functions for estimating and visualizing statistical models of data, such as linear regression and kernel density estimation. Additionally, Seaborn can be used to easily change the style and color of the plots, making it a great tool for creating publication-quality figures.
