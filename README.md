# Seaborn-BootCamp
A comprehensive tutorial for learning Python's Seaborn package. 

Seaborn is a Python data visualization library based on Matplotlib. It provides a high-level interface for creating attractive and informative statistical graphics. Seaborn is particularly well suited for visualizing complex datasets with multiple variables. It provides a variety of plot types, including scatter plots, line plots, bar plots, histograms, and heatmaps, that are designed to work seamlessly with data in Pandas DataFrames. Seaborn also has a number of built-in functions for estimating and visualizing statistical models of data, such as linear regression and kernel density estimation. Additionally, Seaborn can be used to easily change the style and color of the plots, making it a great tool for creating publication-quality figures.

# Here is a cheat sheet of some common Seaborn functions and their usage:

sns.lineplot(x, y): Creates a line plot of x vs y.

sns.scatterplot(x, y): Creates a scatter plot of x vs y.

sns.barplot(x, y): Creates a bar plot of x vs y, with error bars showing the uncertainty of the estimate.

sns.histplot(x): Creates a histogram of x with a kernel density estimate.

sns.kdeplot(x): Creates a kernel density estimate plot of x.

sns.boxplot(x): Creates a box plot of x, showing the median, quartiles, and outliers.

sns.violinplot(x): Creates a violin plot of x, which is similar to a box plot but also shows the probability density of the data.

sns.jointplot(x, y): Creates a scatter plot of x vs y with marginal histograms or density estimates.

sns.pairplot(data): Creates pairwise scatter plots of the columns in the data DataFrame, with optional support for plotting categorical variables and fitting linear regression models.

sns.heatmap(data): Creates a heatmap of the data, with optional clustering and normalization.

sns.clustermap(data): Creates a clustered heatmap of the data, with optional zooming and reordering of rows and columns.
